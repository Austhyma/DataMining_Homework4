====================

In order to run the program, compile using javac as such:

	javac KMeansClustering.java
	
and then: 

	java KMeansClustering <fileToBeClustered>
	
Should return a .csv file containing all the clusters and pertinent information pertaining to them. 
(add more pretentious talks here)

BUGS:
1. Problem with iris file, generates too many class files
TODO:
in KMeansClustering.java:
	1. output Method (Zach)
	2. CalculateWSS (Spencer)
	3. CalculateBSS (Spencer) (Just needs to be tested)
	4. CalculateEntropy (Spencer)
	5. kMeans, and cluster (Auston)
